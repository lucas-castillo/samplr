# Development Version
* Minor:
    * Adds citation information to README

# samplr 1.1.0
* New features:
    * `Zhu23ABS()` now can return estimates when using relative stopping rule.
    * The `Bayesian_Sampler()` function can now be used to not only return expected predictions but also 
        * expected variance
        * simulated predictions.
    * `calc_PSD()` now returns a named vector in `$polyfit`, so users know what's the intercept and what's the slope
    * `calc_PSD()` now filters frequencies within a range, as done in previous literature (Gilden, 1995; Zhu et al., 2022)
* Minor:
    * Fixes documentation of some functions not including the reference list.

# samplr 1.0.1
* Fixes float comparisons using `!=` and thus not passing tests in some OS.  

# samplr 1.0.0
* Initial CRAN submission.
